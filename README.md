# NoCrowdTransit
Recent events have focused public attention on the topic of minimizing personal contact.

Even though a significant amount of workers are able to (at least temporarily) switch to working from home or commute to work via motorized individual transport, the number of urban inhabitants relying on public transport to commute on a daily basis should not be underestimated.

In order to make commuting via bus and trams in cities safer for all people involved, we aim to create a system for analyzing the utilization of buses and bus stops.  

Furthermore,on the basis of historic utilization data we want to develop a prediction-model for finding optimal commuting routes and times with minimal personal contact.With this system, we aim to allow commuters to get to their target location safe and sound within minimal time
